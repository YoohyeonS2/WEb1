    <p>
    Web resources may be any type of downloaded media, but web pages are hypertext documents formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).<br>
    Special HTML syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs which permits users to navigate to other web resources.<br>
    In addition to text, web pages may contain references to images, video, audio, and software components which are either displayed or internally executed in the user's web browser to render pages or streams of multimedia content.<br>
    Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name, make up a website.<br>
    Websites are stored in computers that are running a web server, which is a program that responds to requests made over the Internet from web browsers running on a user's computer. Website content can be provided by a publisher, or interactively from user-generated content.<br>
    Websites are provided for a myriad of informative, entertainment, commercial, and governmental reasons.<br>
