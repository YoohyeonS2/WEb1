    <p>
    JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.<br>
    JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.<br>
    It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.<br>
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.<br>
    Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.<br>
    All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.<br>
    As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.<br>
    It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>
    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.<br>
    In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.<br>
    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.<br>
    Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.<br>
